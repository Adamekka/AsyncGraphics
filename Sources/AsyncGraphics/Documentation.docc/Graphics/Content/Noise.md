# ``AsyncGraphics/Graphic/noise(offset:depth:scale:octaves:seed:resolution:options:)``

## Overview

Noise can be created with octaves (lower (1) is smoother, higher (10) is more noisy), depth (offset in the z axis), seed (to get a unique random noise).

Example with 1 octave:

Example with 10 octaves:
